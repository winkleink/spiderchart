So, I took up the challenge ot create spider diagrams using date from the csv file.

This is the result.
Using Python and Pygame the program reads a CSV file with student names and scores and creates a unique UK A4 jpeg for each student.

It has been developed and runs successfully on a Raspberry Pi 
I have not tested it on any other computers so your milage may be different

# This program takes 3 input files

#Student_Scores.csv 
File with the list of students and their scores 
This is created using Student Scores.ods and OpenOffice

# spider_data_points.csv
Contains the co-ordinates for the didderent points on the spider diagram

# __spider.png
Blank version of the spider diagram
Do not edit this file

On running the code the co-ordinates are read and then each students scores are read and plotted on the screen
Don't worry if the image is too big for your monitor it still works

It then goes through each student plotting and connecting their points by lines
Once completed a .jpeg file is created using the students name as the filename

 Once done you will have individual jpeg files for each of the students with their scores plotted
