So, I took up the challenge ot create spider diagrams using date from the csv file.

This is the result.

pygame and time (for a small pause) are the only libraries used. 
 
Comments from the code below
 
# This code was created in a couple of hours with very little (no real) debugging
# It does one thing (hopefully every time) but there is guarantee that it will work for you.

# It runs successfully on a Raspberry Pi 

# Make sure all 

# This program takes 3 input files

# Student_Scores.csv 
# File with the list of students and their scores 
# This is created using Student Scores.ods and OpenOffice

# spider_data_points.csv
# Contains the co-ordinates for the didderent points on the spider diagram

# __spider.png
# Blank version of the spider diagram
# Do not edit this file

# On running the code the co-ordinates are read and then each students scores are read and plotted on the screen
# Don't worry if the image is too big for your monitor it still works

# It then goes through each student plotting and connecting their points by lines
# Once completed a .jpeg file is created using the students name as the filename

# Once done you will have individual jpeg files for each of the students with their scores plotted
